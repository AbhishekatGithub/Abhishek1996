# Abhishek Venugopal

       Welcome to my GitHub repository
       
My main repository where I submit my coding, data science and analytics projects. All the projects are written in Python and are based on exploration of python libraries, data analytics and machine learning. 

 **Please visit "MyProjects" folder for the notebooks and the code.
 
 
 **NOTE: Read the Readme.md files for getting a glimpse of what the project is about, the approaches and results, which is updated and available for each project under MyProjects folder.**
 
       Projects and activities on the pipeline
       
  1. Tableau / Power BI dashboard which can be directly consumed by end-user for an existing data analysis project in MyProjects portfolio (eg:World Happiness Report 2021)
  
  2. Machine Learning Model deployment using 1) Flask 2) PyWebIO on 1) Heroku and 2) AWS cloud platforms
  
  Find here a simple linear regression salary prediction app I deployed on my Heroku cloud using Flask ( see its Readme.md for app link)

**DESCRIPTION**
              
                     Project 1
   
   **Exploratory analysis of COVID-19 in India**
   
* Scrapped the dynamic COVID-19 medical information of State/Union Territories page from Wikipedia. 
* Rendered an interactive zoom-able map using Folium library along with insightful visualizations of the statistics of the pandemic using seaborn library.
* The data has been scraped from Wikipedia page on COVID-19 ( now the page is not easily findable) which takes in the information from MoHFW | https://mohfw.gov.in , Govt. of     India's official site for COVID-19 data.
* Pandemic statistics of cases, deaths, recoveries etc. are presented as a notebook with a folium map which you can click to get statistics for each state, easy forthe end-user   to interact.

                     Project 2
                
  **Login / Registration GUI application using Python tkinter module with MySQL backend**
    
    * Created a functional GUI based employee login/registration system using tkinter with MySQL connectivity through python for authentication. 
    * Appropriate display of error messages with regex for invalid email IDs or duplicate entries
    * Applied object oriented programming for creating two classes along with buttons and trigger functions.
    * The app can run on PC or in a local host environment when saved as a python executable file.

                     Project 3

   **Sales analysis of electronic goods using Pandas**
       
     * Extracted monthly sales data of electronic products in US states in 2019 (from GitHub), combined them to a single dataframe
     * Derived useful customer insights and answered relevant questions which can translate to improved business through data-driven analysis by extensively using Pandas data          analysis and mining techniques
     * Used Regex, collections and advanced Python concepts to carefully extract the data for answering specific sales/business questions
     
                     Project 4
        
     **E-commerce products classification using LightGBM and OPTUNA**
        
     * Conducted EDA and feature selection in a highly imbalanced dataset containing 0.1M records and 48 right-skewed categorical features having four classes
     * Experimented with SMOTE, data transformation and outlier detection techniques and prepared the data for Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM pipeline 
     * Used OPTUNA hyper-parameter optimization with 20 trials
     * Achieved the best log loss (evaluation metric) score of 1.086 with LightGBM model, placing it in the top 25 % of all predicted models in Kaggle
