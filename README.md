       Welcome to my GitHub repository
       
My main repository where I submit my coding, data science and analytics projects. All the projects are written in Python and are based on exploration of python libraries, data analytics and machine learning. 

 **Please visit "MyProjects" folder for the notebooks and the code  and "Projects" tab to go through the summary**
 
 
 **NOTE: Read the readme.md files for getting a glimpse of what the project is about, the approaches and results, which is updated and available for each project**
