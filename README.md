Hi, 

I am a graduate of IIT Madras, trained in biological sciences, bioinformatics with a minor in Computational biology. I love working with data and getting insights from them and creating high quality visualizations for the consumption of the end-users or stakeholders. Apart from the biotechnology domain, I am also equally interested in applying my data science skills to solve problems and tackle challenges in other domains like healthcare, product analytics, market research, software development etc.

I can code well in Python and work with SQL (intermediate)databases. I am also equipped with good knowledge of Data science, statistics, machine learning algorithms,data mining and visualization,feature engineering and model deployment. I conduct my data analysis mostly using Pandas in Jupyter lab, Google colab and Kaggle kernel. I am also learning BI tools like Power BI and Tableau dashboards and NoSQL databases.

&nbsp;

        Welcome to my GitHub repository
       
My main repository where I submit my coding, data science and analytics projects. All the projects are written in Python and are based on exploration of python libraries, data analytics and machine learning.

### **Please visit "MyProjects" folder for detailed information about the projects**
 &nbsp;
 
 **NOTE: Read the Readme.md files for getting a glimpse of what the project is about, the demo videos, the approaches and results, which is updated and available for each project under MyProjects folder.**
 
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
 
        Projects and activities on the pipeline
       
  1. Tableau / Power BI dashboard which can be directly consumed by end-user for an existing data analysis project in MyProjects portfolio (eg:World Happiness Report 2021)
  
  2. Machine Learning Model deployment using 1) Flask 2) PyWebIO 3) streamlit 4) FAST API on 1) Heroku and 2) AWS cloud platforms

### **NEW MAJOR PROJECT  -  RESUME OPTIMIZER APPLICATION (release Version 1.1)** ü§ì

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

* Created and deployed my own resume optimizer app from scratch, used frequency, tagging , parts of speech, wordcloud in NLP using NLTK library and streamlit

* Employed a self-created resume scoring technique along ATS guidelines with bonus and penalty for keywords( multiplication factor)

* Added an experimental salary prediction feature which I came up with ( which may or may not reveal true world data, but can be used for general cases)

* No web scraping or databases are used for this project, also note that no machine learning algorithms were harmed during the making of this project üìë

* Please read the documentation well before using the analysis, everything is explained in the app webpage itself !

* Larger the volume of the inputs, the better will be the accuracy and performance of the model

 &nbsp;
#### **DEPLOYMENT PROJECT 2 - Streamlit web application**  üõ†Ô∏è

&nbsp;
Deployed a house price prediction streamlit app on Heroku, which not only predicts price but also shows their locations on a map.
  Assumption: Price of property did not vary after the dataset was released in 2014.

### **DESCRIPTION OF PROJECTS ( Python, Data analytics,machine learning)**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
                       
              
                     Project 1
   
   **Exploratory analysis of COVID-19 in India**
   
* Scrapped the dynamic COVID-19 medical information of State/Union Territories page from Wikipedia. 
* Rendered an interactive zoom-able map using Folium library along with insightful visualizations of the statistics of the pandemic using seaborn library.
* The data has been scraped from Wikipedia page on COVID-19 ( now the page is not easily findable) which takes in the information from MoHFW | https://mohfw.gov.in , Govt. of     India's official site for COVID-19 data.
* Pandemic statistics of cases, deaths, recoveries etc. are presented as a notebook with a folium map which you can click to get statistics for each state, easy forthe end-user   to interact.

                     Project 2
                
**Login / Registration GUI application using Python tkinter module with MySQL backend**
    
   * Created a functional GUI based employee login/registration system using tkinter with MySQL connectivity through python for authentication. 
   * Appropriate display of error messages with regex for invalid email IDs or duplicate entries
   * Applied object oriented programming for creating two classes along with buttons and trigger functions.
   * The app can run on PC or in a local host environment when saved as a python executable file.

                     Project 3

 **Sales analysis of electronic goods using Pandas**
       
   * Extracted monthly sales data of electronic products in US states in 2019 (from GitHub), combined them to a single dataframe
   * Derived useful customer insights and answered relevant questions which can translate to improved business through data-driven analysis by extensively using Pandas data          analysis and mining techniques
   * Used Regex, collections and advanced Python concepts to carefully extract the data for answering specific sales/business questions

                     Project 5
                     

**Data Visualization Project 1 : World Happiness Report 2021 -- Is your country happy ?**

* Creating interactive visualizations using Seaborn and Plotly for the World Happiness Report 2021 and find out why some countries are happy or unhappy.
* Dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021
* The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors ‚Äì economic     production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity ‚Äì contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in       Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world‚Äôs lowest national averages for each of the six factors
* Highly interactive charts and graphs for the insights found out through visualization

                     Project 6
                     
**Linear regression model with gradient descent optimizaztion using PyTorch tensors**
                     
 * Weather data of temperature, humidity and rainfall of Kanto region in USA( all values standardized in same scale of SI units)

* Multinomial linear regression in PyTorch using gradient descent optimization. Estimated the yield of crops 1 and 2 as a plane in 3D space obtained by a linear combination of parameters plus the biases
  
* Weights and biases are estimated using random sampling and Torch optimization function (torch.SGD.optim) after 100 epochs to arrive at the best values for the best fit plane.  
* Evaluation: Plots of target values obtained vs real values from randomly sampled test values and R square values
