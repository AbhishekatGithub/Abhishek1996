# Abhishek Venugopal

       Welcome to my GitHub repository
       
My main repository where I submit my coding, data science and analytics projects. All the projects are written in Python and are based on exploration of python libraries, data analytics and machine learning. 

 **Please visit "MyProjects" folder for the notebooks and the code**
 
 **NOTE: Read the Readme.md files for getting a glimpse of what the project is about, the approaches and results, which is updated and available for each project under MyProjects folder.**
 
 
 
 
        Projects and activities on the pipeline
       
  1. Tableau / Power BI dashboard which can be directly consumed by end-user for an existing data analysis project in MyProjects portfolio (eg:World Happiness Report 2021)
  
  2. Machine Learning Model deployment using 1) Flask 2) PyWebIO on 1) Heroku and 2) AWS cloud platforms
  

                DEPLOYMENT PROJECTS
                
 
**DEPLOYMENT PROJECT (NEW) - Streamlit web application**



   Deployed a house price prediction streamlit app on Heroku, which not only predicts price but also shows their locations on a map.
   Assumption: Price of property did not vary after the dataset was released in 2014.

**DESCRIPTION OF PROJECTS ( Python, Data analytics,machine learning)**


              
              
              
                     Project 1
   
   **Exploratory analysis of COVID-19 in India**
   
* Scrapped the dynamic COVID-19 medical information of State/Union Territories page from Wikipedia. 
* Rendered an interactive zoom-able map using Folium library along with insightful visualizations of the statistics of the pandemic using seaborn library.
* The data has been scraped from Wikipedia page on COVID-19 ( now the page is not easily findable) which takes in the information from MoHFW | https://mohfw.gov.in , Govt. of     India's official site for COVID-19 data.
* Pandemic statistics of cases, deaths, recoveries etc. are presented as a notebook with a folium map which you can click to get statistics for each state, easy forthe end-user   to interact.







                     Project 2
                
  **Login / Registration GUI application using Python tkinter module with MySQL backend**
    
    * Created a functional GUI based employee login/registration system using tkinter with MySQL connectivity through python for authentication. 
    * Appropriate display of error messages with regex for invalid email IDs or duplicate entries
    * Applied object oriented programming for creating two classes along with buttons and trigger functions.
    * The app can run on PC or in a local host environment when saved as a python executable file.
    







                     Project 3

   **Sales analysis of electronic goods using Pandas**
       
     * Extracted monthly sales data of electronic products in US states in 2019 (from GitHub), combined them to a single dataframe
     * Derived useful customer insights and answered relevant questions which can translate to improved business through data-driven analysis by extensively using Pandas data          analysis and mining techniques
     * Used Regex, collections and advanced Python concepts to carefully extract the data for answering specific sales/business questions







     
                     Project 4
        
  **E-commerce products classification using LightGBM and OPTUNA**
        
     * Conducted EDA and feature selection in a highly imbalanced dataset containing 0.1M records and 48 right-skewed categorical features having four classes
     * Experimented with SMOTE, data transformation and outlier detection techniques and prepared the data for Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM pipeline 
     * Used OPTUNA hyper-parameter optimization with 20 trials
     * Achieved the best log loss (evaluation metric) score of 1.086 with LightGBM model, placing it in the top 25 % of all predicted models in Kaggle


    
    
    
    
    
    
    
                     Project 5
                     

**Data Visualization Project 1 : World Happiness Report 2021 -- Is your country happy ?**

* Creating interactive visualizations using Seaborn and Plotly for the World Happiness Report 2021 and find out why some countries are happy or unhappy.
* Dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021
* The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic     production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in       Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors
* Highly interactive charts and graphs for the insights found out through visualization








                     Project 6
                     
**Linear regression model with gradient descent optimizaztion using PyTorch tensors**
                     
 * Weather data of temperature, humidity and rainfall of Kanto region in USA( all values standardized in same scale of SI units)

* Multinomial linear regression in PyTorch using gradient descent optimization. Estimated the yield of crops 1 and 2 as a plane in 3D space obtained by a linear combination of parameters plus the biases
   
* Weights and biases are estimated using random sampling and Torch optimization function (torch.SGD.optim) after 100 epochs to arrive at the best values for the best fit plane.  
* Evaluation: Plots of target values obtained vs real values from randomly sampled test values and R square values
