        Motivation
        
Create a resume optimizer and salary prediction web application deployed on the cloud.

        Technologies used
    
NumPy, NLP using NLTK library, multiple regression, conditional weights and biases, streamlit, Heroku

        Methods
    
* Created and deployed my own resume optimizer app from scratch, used frequency, tagging , parts of speech, wordcloud in NLP using NLTK library and streamlit

* Employed a self-created resume scoring technique along ATS guidelines with bonus and penalty for keywords( multiplication factor)

* Added an experimental salary prediction feature which I came up with ( which may or may not reveal true world data, but can be used for general cases)

* No web scraping or databases are used for this project, also note that no machine learning algorithms were harmed during the making of this project ðŸ“‘

* Please read the documentation well before using the analysis, everything is explained in the app webpage itself !

* Larger the volume of the inputs, the better will be the accuracy and performance of the model
