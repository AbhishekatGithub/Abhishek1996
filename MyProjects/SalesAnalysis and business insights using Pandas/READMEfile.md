            The following questions were answered through exploratory data analysis and data mining

 #The data and the plots talk!

1) What month had the highest and lowest sales , and what were the sales numbers?

2)What US city had the highest number of sales ?

3) What time should the business display ads for maximising the likelihood of customers buying products?

4) What products are often sold together?

5)What product is sold the most and why?
