From Aakash Jovian ML-DL course
Dataset obtained from Jovian.
Used Linear Regression model with minimum training data but obtained strong results with 95+ % accuracy due to the planar model of the outputs. High correlation of outputs to linear model ensured high accuracy and precision.\
Used gradient descent method and torch optimization with 1000 epochs to reach 95% accuracy.
